In this experiment, the objective was to produce AM signals, observe the impact of message and carrier frequency on AM signals, and demodulate signals. At first, an AM signal was generated using the message signal and carrier signal while keeping the amplitude of the signals in the marginal range. Then the signal was demodulated using a envelope detector  after receiving usiing a superhetrodyne receiver. According to the lab manual, all the tables were filled up.\\

From the result of the experiment, it can be seen that the message signals were properly recovered for modulation index 0.46 and 1. But when the modulation index was 2.44, they failed to recover the original shape of the message signal. This is due to when the modulation index exceeds 1, phase reversal occurs, and the normal envelope detector circuit fails to recover the message signal. Again on the FFT of the message signal, there was only one peak at the message frequency. But in the recovered message signal, multiple peaks were seen along with the message frequency. This is due to the nonlinearity introduced by the envelope detector circuit. It was also observed that the amplitude of the recovered message signal changed from the original message signal.\\

No difficulties were faced during the experiment.
