\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Why cannot we recover the message signal when the modulation index is more than 1?}\\
    \item \textbf{If the message and carrier amplitudes are 2 and 3 volts, respectively, and the modulation index is 0.8, how much power of the modulated signal will be wasted?}\\
    \item \textbf{If the message and carrier signal frequency are 2 KHz and 100 KHz, respectively, what is the bandwidth of the modulated signal?}\\
    \item \textbf{If the message and carrier signal frequencies are 2 KHz and 100 KHz, respectively, what is the allowable value of RC of an envelope detector?}\\
\end{enumerate}
