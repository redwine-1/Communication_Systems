\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the carrier signal frequency ($f_c$) is 1000 kHz and the message signal frequency ($f_m$) is
    2 kHz, how many frequencies are present in the AM signal?
    \item If the carrier signal frequency ($f_c$) is 1000 kHz and the message signal frequency ($f_m$) is
    2 kHz, what is the lower sideband (LSB) frequency?
    \item What is the impact of the message signal on the modulation index?
    \item What are the benefits of adding the carrier wave to the multiplication of message and
    carrier signals?
\end{enumerate}
